# Glowforge Non-Proofgrade Cut Settings
Record of settings used to success for various non-standard media on the Glowforge laser cutter.

## Corrugated Cardboard

> * Cut: 150 / 50 (speed / power)
 
> * Score: 500 / 40 (speed / power)

> * Engrave: 1000 / 50 (speed / power)

> LPI: 225 (But you can use a much lower LPI for a faster prototype if you're not looking at quality here.)
 
> * Material Height: Usually .125" (1/8")

 * Cardboard is great for prototyping because it's free from Amazon. Most of mine is .125 (1/8) inches thick. Measure yours if precision is important. 
 * Ideally the cardboard should lie flat in the Glowforge's bed; the laser will focus based on that assumption. Avoid cutting over bumps, divots or creases in the material. 
 * <em>For the sake of your house not burning down, don't leave cardboard unattended in the laser.</em> Also follow Glowforge's dire warnings about unsupported material and look out for tape and staples.
 * Mind the order of cuts. Especially with less-than-flat material, a cut shape may fall down when freed from its surroundings. Try to cut inner layers first; you can adjust the cut order in the Glowforge UI.
