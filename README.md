## Card Stock

## Corrugated Cardboard

 * Great for prototyping because it's free from Amazon. Most of mine is .125 (1/8) inches thick. Measure yours if precision is important. 
 * Ideally the cardboard should lie flat in the Glowforge's bed; the laser will focus based on that assumption. Avoid cutting over bumps or divots in the material. 
 * <em>For the sake of your house not burning down, don't leave cardboard unattended in the laser.</em> Also follow GF's dire warnings about unsupported material and look out for tape and staples.
 * Mind the order of cuts. Especially with less-than-flat material, a cut shape may fall down when freed from its surroundings. Try to cut inner layers first; you can adjust the cut order in the GF UI.
